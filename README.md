# Vehicle Management System

This Rust project demonstrates a singleton pattern for managing vehicles.

## Singleton Pattern

The `VehicleManager` struct is implemented as a singleton to manage vehicles. It ensures that only one instance of the manager exists throughout the program's execution.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Rust (stable)
- Cargo (Rust's package manager)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/iNoles/vehicle-rust.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd vehicle-rust
    ```
3. Build the project using Cargo:

   ```bash
   cargo build
   ```

## Usage

The main.rs file demonstrates how to use the VehicleManager singleton to add vehicles and print the total number of vehicles.
